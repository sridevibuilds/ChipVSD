## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Perform transistor-level CMOS simulations using Ngspice with sky130 PDKs to understand:

- NMOS Idâ€“Vds and Idâ€“Vgs behavior  
- CMOS inverter voltage transfer characteristics (VTC)  
- Switching thresholds, rise/fall delays, noise margins  
- Power-supply and device variation effects on robustness  
- Connection between transistor physics and STA concepts

---

## ðŸ§  Why This Task Matters
This task strengthens intuition about how **real device physics** drives digital circuit timing:

- SPICE simulations reveal the "real" Idâ€“Vds and VTC behavior that STA approximates  
- Observe effects of **sizing, supply variation, and short-channel phenomena**  
- Understand **noise margins and robustness** of CMOS inverters  
- Connect device-level behavior to **STA delay models and PVT variations**
