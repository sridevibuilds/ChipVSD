## 💻 SPICE Netlist Example
* NMOS Id vs Vds characteristic
.include sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8.lib
M1 drain gate source 0 sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8 W=1u L=0.15u
Vgs gate 0 0.8
Vds drain source 0
.dc Vds 0 1.8 0.05
.plot dc i(Vds)
.end

## 📊 Plots / Figures
- Annotate linear and saturation regions  
- Mark threshold voltage (Vt) on plots  

---

## 🔍 Observations & Analysis
- Linear region: Id increases linearly with Vds  
- Saturation region: Id flattens as Vds increases (channel pinch-off)  
- Threshold voltage visible from onset of strong inversion  
- SPICE simulations match theoretical predictions  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
- NMOS operation clearly divided into linear and saturation regions  
- SPICE provides a practical way to visualize transistor physics  
- Understanding Id–Vds lays foundation for VTC and CMOS inverter analysis
