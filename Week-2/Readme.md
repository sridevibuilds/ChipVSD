## 🎯 Objective
The goal of **Week 2** is to:
- Build a solid understanding of **SoC fundamentals**.  
- Learn why **BabySoC** is used as a simplified SoC model.  
- Practice **functional modelling** using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**.  

By the end of this week, you should be able to **explain the theory behind SoC design** and also **demonstrate BabySoC functional behaviour through simulation waveforms**.

## 📝 Part 1 – Theory (Conceptual Understanding)

📖 **Reference Notes:**  
[Fundamentals of SoC Design](https://github.com/hemanthkumardm/SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey/tree/main/11.%20Fundamentals%20of%20SoC%20Design)

🔑 **Focus Areas:**
- What is a **System-on-Chip (SoC)?**  
- **Components** of a typical SoC (CPU, Memory, Peripherals, Interconnect).  
- Why **BabySoC** is a simplified model for learning SoC concepts.  
- The role of **Functional Modelling** before RTL and Physical Design.  

📌 **Deliverable:**  
- A **1–2 page write-up** summarizing SoC fundamentals and how BabySoC fits into the learning journey.

## 🛠️ Part 2 – Labs (Hands-on Functional Modelling)

📖 **Lab Reference:**  
[VSDBabySoC Project](https://github.com/hemanthkumardm/SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey/tree/main/12.%20VSDBabySoC%20Project)

🔧 **Tools to be used:**  
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** → Compile Verilog code.  
- **GTKWave** → View simulation waveforms.  

📋 **Steps to Perform:**
1. Clone the **BabySoC Project repo**.  
2. Compile the BabySoC Verilog modules using `iverilog`.  
3. Run simulation and generate `.vcd` waveform files.  
4. Open `.vcd` files in **GTKWave** and analyze:  
   - ✅ Reset operation  
   - ✅ Clocking  
   - ✅ Dataflow between modules  
5. Document the observations with **screenshots of waveforms**.  

📌 **Deliverables:**
- Simulation logs.  
- GTKWave screenshots with highlights.  
- Short explanation for each waveform screenshot.

## 🚀 End Goal (Week 2 Outcomes)
By the end of **Week 2**, you will:  
- Understand the **fundamentals of SoC design**.  
- Explain why **BabySoC** is a great starting point for learning.  
- Demonstrate **functional modelling** of BabySoC through simulations.  
- Build the foundation for **Week 3: RTL Design and Synthesis**.
