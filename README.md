**RISC-V VSD Participants – India**

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress**, including tasks, experiments, and milestones.

> *"In this program, we learn to design a full-fledged System-on-Chip (SoC) — from basic RTL to GDSII — using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to design silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem."*
